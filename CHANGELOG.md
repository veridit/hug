# Changelog

Releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z` and ship one `hug` binary. Earlier part releases
are in [muninn/CHANGELOG.md](muninn/CHANGELOG.md) and the `muninn-v*` and
`huginn-v*` tags.

## v0.7.0 - 2026-11-13

### Added

- One binary, `hug`: `hug task ...` (huginn), `hug mem ...` (muninn), `hug setup`,
  `hug tui`, `hug version`. Called as `muninn` or `huginn` it acts as that part,
  so existing hooks and MCP configs keep working.
- One release per tag: `hug_<version>_<os>_<arch>` archives with hug, muninn and
  huginn; Homebrew `veridit/tap/hug` (the `muninn` and `huginn` formulas now
  install hug); Scoop `hug`; one root `install.sh`.
- `muninn dream --summary`, recall counts in `muninn show`, and dream items that
  ask the driving agent to vet memories unrecalled for 60 days (never archived
  automatically).

### Fixed

- Hooks and MCP configs installed from hug name the `muninn`/`huginn` link, not
  `hug`, which does not know `hook` or `mcp` at the top level.
